# InSites-CAA — AI-Assisted Heritage Significance Assessment

**InSites** is an AI assistant that guides you through a structured significance assessment of built heritage sites. Upload documents about a site, and the assistant walks you through 7 stages (0–6) — identifying what makes the place culturally significant, how authentic it remains, and how it compares to similar sites.

Every claim is evidence-based. Every stage is reviewed by you. The AI proposes; you decide.

## Quick Questions to Ask the Bot

The best way to understand InSites is to ask it. These questions let the bot introduce its own concepts.

### Understand the method

| Ask this | What you'll learn |
|----------|-------------------|
| **"What is InSites?"** | What it does, how it works, what it expects from you |
| **"What is CBSA?"** | The 7-stage assessment method — evidence-based, human-reviewed |
| **"What is context effect?"** | The core principle — how contexts and values shape each other |
| **"What are epistemic markers?"** | How the bot marks what's explicit, inferred 〰️, or interpretive 💭 |
| **"What can't you do?"** | Reveals boundaries — what it won't attempt and why |

### Explore capabilities

| Ask this | What you'll see |
|----------|----------------|
| **"kg"** or **"knowledge graph"** | Interactive map of entities and relationships |
| **"dashboard"** | Multi-tab visual summary of a completed assessment |
| **"read assessment"** | Deep interpretive reading through multiple lenses |
| **"read collection"** | Pattern analysis across multiple site assessments |

### Test its principles

| Ask this | Why it matters |
|----------|---------------|
| **"What evidence supports that claim?"** | Must cite your documents — file and page |
| **"What are the data gaps?"** | Stage 0 identifies what's missing before analysis |
| **"Can you search the web?"** | Should decline — works only with your uploads |

## What the Bot Does

**7-stage assessment (Stages 0–6)** — From document review through contexts, values, authenticity, comparison, significance statement, to quality check. Pauses after every stage for your review.

**Knowledge Graph** — Interactive entity-relationship visualization.

**Assessment Dashboard** — Multi-tab visual summary (values, contexts, timeline, integrity, threats).

**Read-Assessment** — Analytical and interpretive readings of a completed assessment.

**Read-Collection** — Cross-cutting analysis of multiple site assessments.

### Design principles

- **Evidence Mandate** — Uses only your uploaded documents. No external sources, no fabrication.
- **Human-in-the-Loop** — You approve every stage. The AI proposes; you decide.
- **Context Effect** — Bidirectional: contexts frame significance, and significance reframes contexts.
- **Epistemic Transparency** — Claims marked: explicit (sourced), 〰️ inferred, 💭 interpretive.
