# [CA-DB] Assessment Dashboard — CBSA Integration

> **Scope**: This dashboard spec is for **single-assessment** visualization (one site, one CBSA process). For collection-level dashboards (multiple sites), see the MA-RC workflow — collection dashboards have a different data shape and tab structure. Both share the same visual language (stone/amber palette, serif typography).

Generate an interactive Assessment Dashboard as a **Canvas document (HTML)** after Stage 6, when the user explicitly requests it ("dashboard", "summary dashboard", "create dashboard").

⚠ Apply Language Policy to all dashboard text.

---

## 1. Trigger and Offer

- **Mandatory offer** at end of Stage 6: "Would you like me to generate an interactive Assessment Dashboard that visualizes the complete CBSA process?"
- Execute only on acceptance — do not auto-generate.
- The final user-facing deliverable must remain an **Assessment Dashboard**.
- Output as a **Canvas document** (self-contained HTML with inline CSS/JS, D3 from CDN) in final form.
- By default, return the completed dashboard directly.
- Do **not** convert the request into a visible multi-step user workflow unless:
  - essential assessment data is missing, or
  - the user explicitly asks to build it step by step.

## 1A. Build Execution Contract

### Final Outcome Rule
If the user asks for a dashboard, the final outcome must still be a dashboard.

### Staged Internal Build Rule
The assistant may construct the dashboard internally in staged passes.

Preferred order:
1. shell + tabs + routing
2. embedded data object
3. overview + KPI logic
4. analytical tabs
5. charts / D3 / matrix views
6. KG tab / AI shell / polish

This staged build process is internal and should not require extra user confirmations once the dashboard has been requested.

### Reliability Fallback
If the dashboard is too large or likely to be truncated in Canvas:
- generate the full dashboard as a downloadable `.html` file, and
- optionally mirror a stable preview or completed version in Canvas.

This fallback is exceptional. The requested output remains the dashboard.

### Response Discipline
Do **not** expose internal patch steps to the user unless:
- the user asked for step-by-step building, or
- missing data prevents a faithful dashboard.
## 2. Data Extraction

Re-read all stage outputs from the conversation and extract:

| Section | Source | Data to extract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Asset Identity | Stage 0 | Name, location, type, period, brief description (~20 words) |
| Data Quality | Stage 0 | Sources uploaded, identified gaps (list) |
| Timeline | Stage 1 | 5–10 key dated events with **year, label, and change type** (use / structure / setting / infrastructure) |
| Contexts | Stage 1 | Each context: type label, description, **related value categories**, **timespan** |
| Values | Stage 2 | Each value: name, category ([CA-V]), evidence strength (sourced/inferred/uncertain), 1-line summary |
| Attribute Table | Stage 2.2 | Each row: attribute name, associated value categories, site-specific significance, **implication for significance** |
| Authenticity | Stage 3 | Nara Grid as **structured objects**: aspect, attribute description, value expression, integrity rating (high/medium/low-medium/low). Plus summary sentence. |
| Comparative | Stage 4 | Each comparator: name, period, architect (if known), distinction narrative, criteria ratings (rarity, documentation, condition). Plus overall summary. |
| Significance | Stage 5 | Full statement text |
| Vulnerability | Stages 2+3 | Cross-matrix: each value × each Nara aspect → impact level (3=high, 2=medium, 1=low). Derived from Stage 2 implications and Stage 3 ratings. |
| Process Quality | Stage 6 | Quick boosts (list), next steps (list), strengths count, gaps count |
| Knowledge Graph | [CA-KG] | If KG was generated: full nodes and edges JSON. If not: null. |

**Rule**: Only include data that actually appeared in the conversation. Do not fabricate. If a stage was skipped or incomplete, show it as "Not completed" with a visual indicator.

## 3. Data Schema (strict)

```json
{
  "asset": { "name": "", "location": "", "type": "", "period": "", "description": "" },
  "dataQuality": { "sources": ["filename.pdf"], "gaps": ["missing X"] },
  "timeline": [
    { "year": "1923–1924", "yearStart": 1923, "label": "...", "changeType": "structure" }
  ],
  "contexts": [
    { "id": "ctx_hist", "type": "historical", "label": "...", "relatedValues": ["Historical", "Technological"], "timespan": "1915–1960s" }
  ],
  "values": [
    { "id": "v_hist", "name": "...", "category": "Historical", "evidence": "sourced", "summary": "..." }
  ],
  "attributeTable": [
    { "attribute": "...", "values": ["Social", "Symbolic"], "significance": "...", "implication": "..." }
  ],
  "authenticity": {
    "grid": [
      { "aspect": "Form & Design", "description": "...", "valueExpression": "Historical, Aesthetic", "rating": "medium" }
    ],
    "summary": "..."
  },
  "comparative": {
    "summary": "...",
    "comparators": [
      { "name": "...", "period": "...", "architect": "...", "distinction": "...", "criteria": { "rarity": "high", "documentation": "moderate", "condition": "unknown" } }
    ]
  },
  "significance": { "statement": "..." },
  "vulnerability": [
    { "value": "Historical", "form": 3, "material": 3, "use": 2, "setting": 2 }
  ],
  "processQuality": { "strengths": 3, "gaps": 6, "quickBoosts": ["..."], "nextSteps": ["..."] },
  "stagesCompleted": [0,1,2,3,4,5,6],
  "kg": null
}
```

**Schema rules**:
- `authenticity.grid` must be **structured objects** — never flatten the Nara Grid to strings.
- `comparative.comparators` must be **per-site objects** with criteria — never a flat name list.
- `timeline[].changeType` is mandatory — every event classifies what kind of change occurred.
- `contexts[].relatedValues` links each context to the value categories it generates — this enables cross-referencing.
- `vulnerability` is derived by cross-reading Stage 2 implications against Stage 3 ratings. Impact levels: 3 = loss of this integrity aspect severely damages this value; 2 = moderate damage; 1 = minor or indirect.

## 4. Tab Structure (mandatory)

Each CBSA stage must have its own tab. Do not merge stages.

```
Overview → Timeline → Contexts → Values → Integrity → Comparative → Significance → [Vulnerability] → Process → [KG]
```

Brackets = conditional (Vulnerability only if data exists; KG only if generated during session).

| Tab | Content | Key features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Overview** | KPIs, asset description, integrity range, data gaps | KPIs: Values count, Evidence rate, Contexts count, Data Gaps count (not "Completion: 100%"). Integrity range shows color-coded ratings per aspect. |
| **Timeline** | Chronological events | **Proportional spacing** based on year gaps. **Color-coded** by change type (use/structure/setting/infrastructure). Distribution summary. |
| **Contexts** | Context cards with related values | Each card shows: type label, description, timespan, **clickable value pills**. Clicking a context highlights related values in Values tab. |
| **Values** | Value cards + Attribute-Value-Implication table | Cards: name, category pill, evidence indicator (●/◐/○), summary. Below: full attribute table with implication warnings. |
| **Integrity** | Nara Grid cards + summary | Each card: aspect name, description, value expression pills, **color-coded rating badge** (high=green → low=red). Left border color matches rating. |
| **Comparative** | Per-comparator cards + summary | Each card: name, period, architect, criteria ratings (color-coded), distinction narrative. Source note. |
| **Significance** | Statement of cultural significance | Styled as a featured block. |
| **Vulnerability** | Heat matrix: values × Nara aspects | Rows = value categories, columns = Nara aspects. Column headers show current integrity rating. Cells colored by impact (red/amber/neutral). 2–3 sentence interpretive callout. |
| **Process** | KPIs, next steps, quick boosts, sources | Three-column KPI (strengths/gaps/boosts). Two-column layout: next steps + quick boosts. Sources list. |
| **KG** | Embedded MiniKG with floating popover | D3 force-directed graph. Banner noting standalone KG has richer features. See §7 for interaction. |

## 5. Cross-Referencing (mandatory)

The dashboard must implement a shared selection state:

- **Clicking a context** → highlights its related values in the Values tab.
- **Clicking a value** → highlights matching contexts and integrity aspects.
- **Navigating between tabs** preserves the active highlight.
- **Visible indicator** (banner) shows what is currently highlighted, with a Clear action.

Implementation: a top-level `highlight` variable (`{ type: 'value'|'context', id: string } | null`) checked by each tab renderer.

## 6. Theme and Readability (mandatory)

**Light theme throughout**: All tabs — including KG — use the same light palette. This ensures visual coherence between the Dashboard and the standalone KG artifact.

**Light palette** (all tabs):
```
Background: #f8fafc → cards: #ffffff → borders: #e2e8f0
Text: #1e293b → dim: #64748b → muted: #94a3b8
Accent: #2563eb — or site-appropriate
```

**Minimum readability requirements**:
- Body text: ≥ 0.84rem, contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1
- Section labels / uppercase micro-labels: ≥ 0.72rem
- Pills and badges: ≥ 0.66rem
- KG edge labels: ≥ 10px, contrast ratio ≥ 3:1
- KG node labels: include text-shadow or halo for legibility against light background
- **No text below 0.62rem anywhere**

## 7. KG Node Interaction (MiniKG)

When a user clicks a KG node, display a **floating popover** adjacent to the clicked node:

- **Position**: prefer right of node; flip left near container edge; clamp vertically within SVG bounds.
- **Content**: node name (≥1rem, bold), type badge, meaning (≥0.88rem), connections list with directional arrows and verb labels.
- **Connection items**: styled as mini-cards (background + border), colored verb labels, white entity names.
- **Animate entrance**: scale+fade, ≤200ms.
- **Dismiss on**: close button, background click, or clicking another node.
- **Never require scrolling** to read node info — all content visible within the graph viewport.

## 8. Dashboard UX — 7-Lens Design Constraints

When building the dashboard (not reviewing), apply these lenses as design constraints:

### Lens 1: Information Architecture
- Overview tab first. Order: orientation → analysis → detail.
- Each tab answers a clear analytical question.
- Most important information easiest to reach.

### Lens 2: Chart & Visualization Choices
- Chart types based on data shape: bar for comparison, scatter for relationships, matrix for cross-tabulation.
- Color encodings carry consistent meaning across views.
- Axes, labels, legends clear without reading code.

### Lens 3: Map (if applicable)
- Map must add analytical value, not just decoration.
- Markers encode useful information beyond location.

### Lens 4: Interactivity & User Flow
- Shared entities clickable across all views.
- Cross-filtering between views.
- Selection state visible and clear.
- `history.pushState()` or hash routing on every tab switch.
- After cross-tab jumps, show "← Back to [previous tab]" pill.
- Encode active tab in URL hash (`#timeline`, `#values`).
- Sort/scroll state preserved across tab switches.

### Lens 5: Data Integrity
- All statistics computed from data — never hardcoded.
- No silent truncation or filtering.
- Computed values reflect meaningful criteria.
- Rich fields in data never left unused.

### Lens 6: Visual Design
- Sans-serif font stack (system-ui, Inter) for UI. Monospace for numeric cells.
- CSS custom properties for all design tokens.
- Card containers with elevation for content groups.
- Pill/segment tab controls.
- Neutral palette + one accent family.
- Bidi auto-detection for mixed-language data (set `dir="auto"` on text containers with heritage content).

### Lens 7: Storytelling
- Subtitles and annotations on outliers.
- Dynamic callouts that surface patterns.
- Collapsible "How to read this" guide box on key tabs with: "What you see", "How to interact", and an insight callout.
- Surface text fields as searchable/filterable content.

### Build Checklist
- [ ] Overview tab with KPI cards + distribution charts
- [ ] Data embedded as JS object (single source of truth)
- [ ] All statistics computed from data
- [ ] Every entity name clickable across views
- [ ] URL hash routing (`#tab-name`)
- [ ] Guide box on complex tabs (collapsible)
- [ ] CSS custom properties for design tokens
- [ ] Card containers with elevation
- [ ] Pill/segment tab controls
- [ ] Bidi auto-detection on heritage text
- [ ] Evidence indicators (●/◐/○) consistent across all tabs
- [ ] Nara Grid stored as structured objects
- [ ] fadeIn animation on tab switch
- [ ] Large dashboards may be assembled in staged internal passes
- [ ] Canvas reliability fallback allowed: full `.html` file + Canvas preview if needed

## 9. AI Query in Dashboard

If the KG tab is present, include the same Gemini AI Query capability as described in `kg-spec.md` §5:

- Configuration panel (collapsible, Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- User-provided Gemini API key stored in localStorage (`insites_gemini_key`)
- System prompt referencing the KG data JSON
- Chat interface within the KG tab sidebar
- Starter prompts when chat is empty

> **GPT v1 note**: In GPT v1 the AI Query tab is placeholder-only — visible and styled but does not execute live API calls. Route interpretation requests to GPT chat instead. See `kg-spec.md` §13 for full placeholder behaviour.

## 10. Final Checklist

1. Only include data from the conversation — never fabricate.
2. If a stage was not completed, show as incomplete in progress bar and mark "Not completed" in its tab.
3. Evidence indicators (●/◐/○) must match Stage 2 markers and appear consistently in all tabs that reference values.
4. KG tab appears only if KG was generated during the session; Vulnerability tab only if data exists.
5. Replace `__DATA__` and `__ASSET_NAME__` placeholders with extracted content.
6. **All CBSA stages (1–6) have dedicated tabs** — no merged stages.
7. **Attribute-Value-Implication table** present in Values tab.
8. **Cross-referencing** implemented: at least Context↔Value linking functional.
9. **Readability**: no text below 0.62rem; no contrast ratio below 3:1.
10. **Nara Grid** stored as structured objects, not parsed strings.
11. **CDN source**: Use `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` exclusively for all external libraries (D3, Leaflet, Chart.js). Do NOT use unpkg.com or jsdelivr.net. Add a `typeof` guard before initializing CDN-dependent features.
12. **Inline data**: All extracted data must be embedded inline as JS objects. Do NOT use `fetch()` — the dashboard must work when opened via `file://` protocol without a server.
13. **Leaflet popup close button**: Leaflet's popup close is `<a href="#close">` — in sandbox environments, hash links get rewritten. After map init, add: `document.addEventListener('click',function(e){if(e.target.closest('.leaflet-popup-close-button')){e.preventDefault();mapInstance.closePopup();}});`
14. **Chart.js stability**: For doughnut/pie charts, do NOT set `maintainAspectRatio:false` — it causes infinite expansion. Add `canvas{max-height:280px}` CSS to chart containers. Only use `maintainAspectRatio:false` for bar charts in constrained-height containers.

## 11. Post-Dashboard Offers (mandatory)

After generating the Dashboard, always offer:

> "Would you like me to export this assessment as a formatted Word document?"

Use **Code Interpreter** for the export — generate a styled `.docx` file with all dashboard content formatted for print.

## 12. Reference Data Shape — Ayelet HaShachar

The Ayelet HaShachar water tower assessment dashboard (`Single-Dashboard-example.html`) implements this spec fully: light theme throughout, all 10 tabs, cross-referencing with shared highlight state, structured Nara Grid, per-comparator cards, vulnerability matrix, proportional timeline with change types, and floating KG popover. Use it as a working example — not as a locked template.

This section describes the data shape and rendering approach used in that reference. Your generated data must follow this shape exactly.

---

### Asset Identity

The `asset` object is a flat dictionary with five string fields: `name`, `location`, `type`, `period`, and `description` (~20 words).

Example:
- name: "Water Tower, Kibbutz Ayelet HaShachar"
- type: "Rural Water Tower — Kibbutz Infrastructure"
- period: "1923–1924 (Mandatory Palestine)"

This populates the Overview tab header.

### Data Quality

`dataQuality` contains two arrays: `sources` (filenames as strings) and `gaps` (concise gap descriptions). The Ayelet assessment had 2 sources and 6 gaps. The Overview tab renders sources as a list and gaps as warning badges.

### Timeline

`timeline` is an array of event objects. Each must have:
- `year` (display string, e.g., "1923–1924")
- `yearStart` (integer for proportional positioning)
- `label` (what happened)
- `changeType` (one of: "fabric", "infrastructure", "use", "setting", "interpretation" — matching [CA-T] in `cbsa-method.md`)

The Ayelet timeline had 8 events spanning 1915–1961. Change types were: 3× fabric, 2× use, 2× infrastructure, 1× setting.

**Rendering**: The Timeline tab renders events on a proportional horizontal axis where spacing reflects actual year gaps. Events are color-coded by `changeType` (e.g., fabric=blue, use=green, setting=amber, infrastructure=purple, interpretation=teal). A distribution summary below shows the count per change type.

### Contexts

`contexts` is an array of context objects. Each must have:
- `id` (e.g., "ctx_hist")
- `type` (from [CA-C]: "historical", "social", etc.)
- `label` (the site-specific context description, 2–4 sentences)
- `relatedValues` (array of value category names from [CA-V])
- `timespan` (e.g., "1915–1960s")

The Ayelet assessment identified 6 contexts, each linked to 1–3 value categories.

**Rendering**: Cards with type badge, description, timespan, and clickable value pills. Clicking a context card activates cross-referencing: it highlights matching values in the Values tab.

### Values

`values` is an array. Each must have:
- `id` (e.g., "v_hist")
- `name` (the "Value Type — Value Meaning" compound, e.g., "Historical — Infrastructure as Survival")
- `category` (the [CA-V] type name)
- `evidence` (one of: "sourced", "inferred", "uncertain")
- `summary` (one-line description)

The Ayelet assessment identified 5 values with evidence: 3 sourced, 2 inferred.

**Rendering**: Cards show the value name, a category-colored pill, an evidence indicator (● sourced, ◐ inferred, ○ uncertain), and the summary. Below the cards: the full Attribute-Value-Implication table from `attributeTable`.

### Attribute Table

`attributeTable` is an array. Each row:
- `attribute` (the physical or conceptual attribute)
- `values` (array of value category names)
- `significance` (≤9 words)
- `implication` (what happens if this attribute is compromised)

**Rendering**: Styled table with value pills in the second column and the implication as a warning-toned text.

### Authenticity (Nara Grid)

`authenticity` contains:
- `grid`: array of structured objects, each with `aspect`, `description`, `valueExpression`, and `rating` (high / medium / low-medium / low)
- `summary`: one paragraph

The four aspects are always: Form & Design, Material & Fabric, Use & Function, Location & Setting.

**Rendering**: Cards with left border colored by rating (green→high, amber→medium, orange→low-medium, red→low). Each card shows the aspect name as header, description as body, value expression as pills, and a rating badge. The summary appears below.

### Comparative

`comparative` contains:
- `summary`: overall comparison narrative
- `comparators`: array of objects, each with `name`, `period`, `architect` (may be null), `distinction` (narrative), and `criteria` (object with keys like `rarity`, `documentation`, `condition` — values are "high", "moderate", "low", "unknown")

The Ayelet assessment compared 3 water towers.

**Rendering**: Per-comparator cards. Each shows name/period header, architect (if known), criteria as color-coded badges, and distinction text. Summary paragraph above.

### Significance

`significance` has one field: `statement` (the full Stage 5 text, 3–5 paragraphs).

**Rendering**: Featured block with distinct typography — larger font, left accent border, generous padding. Treat as the centerpiece of the dashboard.

### Vulnerability Matrix

`vulnerability` is an array. Each row:
- `value` (value category name)
- `form` (impact level 1–3)
- `material` (impact level 1–3)
- `use` (impact level 1–3)
- `setting` (impact level 1–3)

Impact levels: 3 = loss severely damages this value, 2 = moderate damage, 1 = minor.

**Rendering**: Heat matrix table. Column headers show the Nara aspect name AND its current integrity rating from the authenticity grid. Cells colored: 3=red, 2=amber, 1=neutral/grey. Below: 2–3 sentence interpretive callout identifying the most critical vulnerability intersection.

### Process Quality

`processQuality` contains:
- `strengths` (integer count)
- `gaps` (integer count)
- `quickBoosts` (array of strings)
- `nextSteps` (array of strings)

**Rendering**: Three-column KPI row (strengths / gaps / boosts count). Below: two-column layout with next steps (left) and quick boosts (right). Sources list at bottom.

### KG (conditional)

`kg` is either `null` (no KG generated) or the full `{ nodes, edges }` object from the KG spec.

**Rendering**: If present, render a MiniKG tab with D3 force-directed graph (light theme), floating popover on node click, and a banner: "The standalone Knowledge Graph has richer features including analytics and AI queries." If KG included AI capability, include the Gemini chat panel here too.

### Stages Completed

`stagesCompleted` is an array of integers [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]. Any stage not in this array renders as "Not completed" in its tab with a muted indicator.

---

### Key Rendering Principles

1. **Single source of truth**: All data lives in one `DATA` object at the top of the HTML. Every statistic, count, and label is computed from this object — never hardcoded.

2. **Cross-referencing**: A global `highlight` state (value or context ID) propagates across tabs. When active, matching elements get a visual highlight and non-matching elements are dimmed.

3. **Proportional timeline**: Year gaps determine spacing. A 40-year gap gets more horizontal space than a 2-year gap.

4. **Consistent evidence indicators**: ● / ◐ / ○ appear everywhere a value is referenced — cards, tables, pills.

5. **Structured Nara Grid**: The grid is always an array of objects with typed fields — never a flat string or paragraph.

6. **Tab navigation**: Hash-based routing. Each tab switch updates `location.hash`. On load, read hash to restore tab state.
